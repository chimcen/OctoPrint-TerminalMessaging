# Octoprint-TerminalMessaging

Plugin that adds styling to the terminal tab that makes it easier to see where a message is from.

Messages you send are on the right and are in yellow. Messages the printer sends back are on the left
and in orange with a bigger font size.

This is similar to how a text messaging app would differentiate between sender and receiver in the
UI.

This plugin is very small, and just edits the css of the elements in the terminal for readability.

## More theming

If you want a different text size, or a different color, or maybe you don't want the sent on the
right. You can adjust all of that to your heart's content. I recommend using
[Themify](https://github.com/birkbjo/OctoPrint-Themeify) to adjust these two types of fields.

In Themeify, you can check "Enable customization" and then you can attach any rules to the
`span.received` or `span.sent`. Those are the lines in the terminal for sent and received messages.

For example, if you don't want the right justified sent messages, you could do this:

|selector|CSS-Rule|value|
|-|-|-|
|span.sent|text-align|left|

If you want to make the text a little bigger, you might add these rules:

|selector|CSS-Rule|value|
|-|-|-|
|span.received|font-size|18px|
|span.received|line-height|24px|
|span.sent|font-size|18px|
|span.sent|line-height|24px|

If you want a different color for the received messages, you could do this:

|selector|CSS-Rule|value|
|-|-|-|
|span.received|color|red|

Enjoy!
